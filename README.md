# Kickstarter

Dataset was collected online. Used machine learning algorithms to predict the success probability of the project to reach the goal amount
quoted to be successful. Though the idea of the project plays an important role, the content in the kickstarter page also plays an 
important role. For example, the content used like more words or pictures may not catch the attention of the viewers. We have also used
the google trends for the project. And we finally arrived at some interesting insights from the available data.
